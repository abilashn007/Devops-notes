Type of pipeline job in Jenkins
 
Scripted pipeline 
- Traditional way of defining pipeline job.
- Most of the configuration we need to define manually.
- All the configuration should be inside the node block. 
	
Declarative pipeline 
- New way of defining pipeline job.
- Most of the configuration are pre-defined.
- All the configuration should be inside the pipeline block. 
- The mandatory components of pipeline will be agent, stages, stage, steps			

Jenkinsfile	
	- It is the file in which we write all our job configuration in groovy.
	- In our company we are using declarative pipeline in Jenkinsfile and we are maintaining 
	  Jenkinsfile through git.	

How to define a pipeline job in Jenkins
	1. We can add pipeline configuration in 2 ways 
		a. We write all the configuration inside the pipeline job in job ui only.
		b. We can write all the configuration in a file called Jenkinsfile and we can add that 
		   from a SCM/Version control 
	2. We are using only declarative pipeline type in our company.

Agent
	- An agent is a declarative used to define the execution method for pipeline stages.
	- agent is the one which tell stages to execute on which node and its executor.
	- Agent can be specified at two levels 
				a. pipeline level 
				b. Stage level
		
	Types of agent 
		any 
			- This is the default agent, If I wont specify any agent this will be considered.
			- Runs the pipeline stages on any available node executor.
			
		none 
			-  To define executor for each and every stage declare agent as none at pipeline level.
			-  Using this we specify Jenkins that agent is controlled at each stage level.
			-  Defining agent at stage level is mandatory. 
				
		label 
			- we can define agent as label at pipeline to run all the stages of pipeline
			  on a particular node with label.

How to run a job parallel 
	- we can run free style job parallel by using "Execute concurrent builds" in general section 
	
	Pipeline 
	- By default pipeline job runs concurrently.
	- To run stages parallel we need to define the stages inside parallel block.

Environment variable 
	- env variables cab be declared both at pipeline and stage level.
		environment {
			NAME = value
		}
	- environment variables can be accessed suing env keyword 
		env.NAME

Parameters 
	- parameters cab be declared only at pipeline level.
		parameters {
		     string(name: 'BRANCH', description: 'Enter the branch to build', defaultValue: 'main')
		}

	- Parameters can be accessed suing 'params' keyword 
		params.NAME

Continue the Jenkins pipeline even if the stage fails
	- To handle the exception 
		catch the error 
		example: catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'FAILURE') {
 
		}
